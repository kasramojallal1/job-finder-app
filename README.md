# Project Recommendation System

## Description

The Project Recommendation System is a sophisticated tool designed to enhance the efficiency of matching freelancers with suitable project opportunities. This system leverages machine learning techniques to analyze project descriptions and user inputs, creating personalized recommendations that align with the freelancers' skills, salary expectations, and experience levels. By using a fine-tuned transformer model and cosine similarity, our system provides highly relevant project suggestions, ensuring a match that not only meets professional qualifications but also career aspirations.

## Features

- **Skill Extraction**: Utilizes advanced NLP techniques to extract key skills from project descriptions.
- **Vectorization**: Converts text data into numerical data, allowing for efficient similarity calculations.
- **Cosine Similarity Calculation**: Determines the similarity between user skills and project requirements.
- **Dynamic Filtering**: Filters projects based on user-defined criteria such as salary range and experience level.
- **Streamlit Web Interface**: Offers an intuitive and interactive user interface for easy access and usage.

## Usage

To run the web application locally:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
Navigate to `localhost:8501` in your web browser to view the application.

## How It Works

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the raw project data to enhance the model's accuracy.
2. **Recommendation Engine**: Analyze processed data to match projects with the freelancer's profile using cosine similarity.
3. **User Interface**: Use the Streamlit framework to enable freelancers to interactively input their preferences and receive tailored project recommendations.
